Python Chat Bot
GPT Bot is a Python-based chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model. It can generate human-like responses based on the given input, making it suitable for various conversational applications.

Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher
OpenAI Python library (openai)

Installation

Clone the repository or download the source code:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gpt-bot.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd gpt-bot

Install the dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up OpenAI API
Sign up for an API key at the OpenAI website.
Set the API key as an environment variable in your terminal:
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'

Usage
To use the GPT Bot, run the following command:
python bot.py

Once the bot is running, enter your desired input or question, and the bot will generate a response based on the input using the GPT-3.5 language model. You can continue the conversation by providing further input.

Configuration
The bot's behavior can be configured by modifying the bot.py file. The following parameters can be adjusted:

temperature: Controls the randomness of the bot's responses. Higher values (e.g., 0.8) make the output more random, while lower values (e.g., 0.2) make it more focused and deterministic.
max_tokens: Limits the length of the generated response. Adjust this value according to your requirements.

Disclaimer
This project is a proof-of-concept and should be used with caution. The accuracy and appropriateness of the generated responses depend on the training data provided to the language model. It's important to review and filter the responses according to your application's requirements.
